<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">The year was 1952. And Portland was still without its first television
station. Long after all other large American cities were tuning in, Portland was
the second-largest city in the United States to be without local TV (Denver,
Colorado was the largest.) Then on August 25, 1952, the light turned
green. In a lightning fast three week period, all construction, tests and
operations were completed by new owners, The Empire Coil Company, to make KPTV a
functioning television station.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">On September 20, 1952, at 4:30pm, KPTV aired its first telecast. It was a
historic event, not only for Oregon, but for the world, because KPTV was the
very first UHF, or Ultra High Frequency, station.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">The Empire Coil Company was started in New Rochelle, New
York, by Herbert Mayer in 1944 with five employees. Mayer was a New York City
lawyer until World War II. He became involved in the electronics business to
help the war effort and found that it was his great love. After VJ Day, the
company began to manufacture radio coils and transformers. In 1949, Mayer bought
and developed WXEL-TV, a VHF station in Cleveland, Ohio.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">In August 1952, Empire Coil purchased a two-and-one-half
year old RCA experimental UHF station in Bridgeport Connecticut. The transmitter
was dismantled and shipped fast freight and trucked to Portland, where it was
reassembled by the same RCA engineers. All parts were coded and a day and night
shift of workers aided in its installation, which was completed September 11.
The 250-foot tower on Council Crest was begun on September 9th and completed on
September 11th in time to receive the RCA Victor antenna. The first program was
broadcast just 26 days after the ground was broken for the transmitter.</font></p>

program was a documentary about the experimental UHF transmitter, which became
the KPTV transmitter. At 5:00pm, KPTV picked up NBC's &quot;All Star Revue&quot;
with Jimmy Durante and Margaret Truman. At 5:30pm was &quot;Your Show of
Shows&quot; with Sid Caesar and Imogene Coca. Sign off was at 7:30pm. On Sunday,
September 21, sign-on was at 6:00pm with &quot;Philco Television
Playhouse,&quot; featuring &quot;Five Fathers of Pepi&quot; starring Jose
Ferrer.
Test signals were aired from 7:00-8:00pm and the movie &quot;Meet John Doe&quot;
with Gary Cooper and Barbara Stanwyck aired from 8:00-10:10pm.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">Regular full scale programming began on October 
1st with the
World Series. The New York Yankees beat the Brooklyn Dodgers four games to
three. KPTV used shows from all available network sources: NBC, CBS, ABC and
DuMont.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">The DuMont Network was founded by Dr. Alan B. Dumont, who
perfected the cathode ray tube. He introduced the first commercial televisions
sets in 1939 and began the first television network with 66 stations.</font></p>

ensconced in the living room. Etiquette columns urged consumers to purchase sets
for the dining room to prevent families from eating in the front room.
&quot;Meals can be eaten properly and comfortably and Junior's bread crumbs and
father's pie ala mode present no danger to expensive rugs,&quot; said an ad in
the Oregonian newspaper. Non-TV set owners watched an average of 12 hours per
week at others homes, and it was rumored that in some communities, babysitters
snubbed non-set owners.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">Optometrists offered special TV watching glasses to
prevent &quot;telestrain&quot; and viewers were advised to shift their gaze when
viewing for long periods of time to prevent eye strain. In studies done at the
time, two-thirds of those polled said they did less reading, and two-thirds did
less visiting. Magazine reading
decreased
25 percent as did patronage in bars
and taverns. Television was known as &quot;the poor-man's theater.&quot;</font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">Because KPTV was a UHF station, new sets had to be
modified at the factory. Dealers could not keep sets in stock and there were
waiting lists of up to six months. Television sets were expensive by 1952
standards, with costs ranging from two to four hundred dollars. By February 28,
1953, 72,839 sets had been sold in the Portland Area.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">Primary coverage of KPTV extended about 20 miles. The
population of Portland was approximately 750,000 in 1952.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">Some things haven't changed much since 1952. In November
of that year, Mayer said &quot;Some of the programs are downright improper for
children. I don't let my own watch it too much. Sometimes I have to shut off the
set and chase them out of the house on Saturday afternoon.&quot;</font></p>

<p align="center"><i><b><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">1952 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION...</font></b></i></p>

<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">Television brought a new political fire to the area with
the first locally broadcast coverage of the Presidential election. In September
1952, KPTV aired Senator Richard Nixon's famous &quot;Checkers&quot; speech.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">
<img border="1" src="pix/eisenhower.jpg" align="right" width="160" height="119">The Presidential election between Dwight Eisenhower and
Adlai Stevenson was November 4, 1952. This was the first election in the greater
Portland area where voters became better acquainted with the candidates through
the medium of television. In the months before the conventions, numerous
candidates gobbled up every spare minute of TV time nationwide. Eisenhower and
Stevenson were booked for 20 nationwide telecasts each before the election. Both
men had excellent television personalities. Ike's first major televised speech
ran overtime, and he was cut off in mid-sentence!</font></p>

<p align="center"><b><i><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">ADVERTISING...</font></i></b></p>

<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">After three weeks, KPTV air time was sold out with local
commercials. No national spots were sold. Eight seconds of air time went for
$17.50, one minute sold for $35 and 52 half-hour programs went for $127.50 each.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">Viewer polls showed that 24 percent of viewers preferred
animated cartoon-type commercials. Only one percent preferred the pitchman-type
commercials that advertisers thought would be perfect for the medium.</font></p>

<p align="center"><i><b><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">NEW CAREERS...</font></b></i></p>

<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">The industry spawned new careers for television engineers
as well as television repairmen. The medium was so new that it was virtually
impossible to hire people trained in the field. Portland bookseller, J.K. Gill
stocked a large selection of technical books on the television service industry.
Set owners were warned not to try to service their sets themselves because of
dangerously high electrical voltage.</font></p>

Portland’s only non-network station, KPTV turned its focus to local
programming, dubbing itself “The Northwest Personality Station.” On-air
talent such as Gene
Brendler, circus clown Rusty Nails, wrestling commentator
Frank Bonnema and sportscaster Jimmy Jones brought Portland viewers a daily dose
of news, information, sports action, features and fun. The decade also witnessed
the arrival of Rod Anders, who became the nation’s longest running
children’s show host, helming <i>The Ramblin’ Rod Cartoon Show </i>for 33
years. The viewers responded, and by 1968, KPTV had become the number one
independent station in the United States.<o:p>

KPTV

time

losing

not
an

compared

schedule,
which
was
populated
by
such
weak

as

and

sank
like
a

Besides

1987,

announced
plans
to
drop
the

Desperate
for
the
exposure

powerhouse
VHF
station
like
KPTV,
officials
at
Fox
pleaded
with
with
owner

not
to
break
up
the
network
family
(a
similar
action
was
being

KPTV
put
off
plans
temporarily,

by
early
1988,
KPTV
began
pre-empting
Fox's
Saturday
night
schedule
in
favor
of
<i>The
Movie,</i>
which
not
only
pulled
more
viewers,
but
also
offered
substantially
more
commercial
inventory
for
the
station.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial"><span style="font-weight: normal; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">Unable
to convince owner Chris-Craft to reinstate the programming, Fox declined to
renew their affiliation agreement with KPTV, and on August 29, 1988,
the
network
moved
to upstart KPDX(49), with the promise that the station would run <i>all </i>of
the Fox programming.
Ironically,
KPTV's
last
Fox
program
was
the
network's
first
broadcast
of

the 1990s, as more stations signed-on and cable penetrated the Portland market,
KPTV responded with <i>Northwest Reports</i>, the nation’s first local
newsmagazine, and first run syndicated programs, such as <i>Babylon 5</i>, <i>Lonesome
Dove</i>, and <i>Baywatch</i>. In 1996, Good Day Oregon premiered as the</font></span><font color="#FFFFFF"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:Arial;font-weight:normal;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">
