<p class="auto-style1"><font color="#FFFFFF">The year was 1952. And Portland was still without its first television
station. Long after all other large American cities were tuning in, Portland was
the second-largest city in the United States to be without local TV (Denver,
Colorado was the largest.) Then on August 25, 1952, the light turned
green. In a lightning fast three week period, all construction, tests and
operations were completed by new owners, The Empire Coil Company, to make KPTV a
functioning television station.</font></p>
<p class="auto-style1"><font color="#FFFFFF">On September 20, 1952, at 4:30pm, KPTV aired its first telecast. It was a
historic event, not only for Oregon, but for the world, because KPTV was the
very first UHF, or Ultra High Frequency, station.</font></p>

    <p class="auto-style1"><font color="#FFFFFF">The Empire Coil Company was started in New Rochelle, New
York, by Herbert Mayer in 1944 with five employees. Mayer was a New York City
lawyer until World War II. He became involved in the electronics business to
help the war effort and found that it was his great love. After VJ Day, the
company began to manufacture radio coils and transformers. In 1949, Mayer bought
and developed WXEL-TV, a VHF station in Cleveland, Ohio.</font></p>

<p class="auto-style1"><font color="#FFFFFF">In August 1952, Empire Coil purchased a two-and-one-half
year old RCA experimental UHF station in Bridgeport Connecticut. The transmitter
was dismantled and shipped fast freight and trucked to Portland, where it was
reassembled by the same RCA engineers. All parts were coded and a day and night
shift of workers aided in its installation, which was completed September 11.
The 250-foot tower on Council Crest was begun on September 9th and completed on
September 11th in time to receive the RCA Victor antenna. The first program was
broadcast just 26 days after the ground was broken for the transmitter.</font></p>

program was a documentary about the experimental UHF transmitter, which became
the KPTV transmitter. At 5:00pm, KPTV picked up NBC's &quot;All Star Revue&quot;
with Jimmy Durante and Margaret Truman. At 5:30pm was &quot;Your Show of
Shows&quot; with Sid Caesar and Imogene Coca. Sign off was at 7:30pm. On Sunday,
September 21, sign-on was at 6:00pm with &quot;Philco Television
Playhouse,&quot; featuring &quot;Five Fathers of Pepi&quot; starring Jose
Ferrer.
Test signals were aired from 7:00-8:00pm and the movie &quot;Meet John Doe&quot;
with Gary Cooper and Barbara Stanwyck aired from 8:00-10:10pm.</span></font></p>

<p class="auto-style1"><font color="#FFFFFF">Regular full scale programming began on October 
1st with the
World Series. The New York Yankees beat the Brooklyn Dodgers four games to
three. KPTV used shows from all available network sources: NBC, CBS, ABC and
DuMont.</font></p>

<p class="auto-style1"><font color="#FFFFFF">The DuMont Network was founded by Dr. Alan B. Dumont, who
perfected the cathode ray tube. He introduced the first commercial televisions

    <p class="auto-style1"><font color="#FFFFFF">TV mania swept the region. Meal hours found families
ensconced in the living room. Etiquette columns urged consumers to purchase sets
for the dining room to prevent families from eating in the front room.
&quot;Meals can be eaten properly and comfortably and Junior's bread crumbs and
father's pie ala mode present no danger to expensive rugs,&quot; said an ad in
the Oregonian newspaper. Non-TV set owners watched an average of 12 hours per
week at others homes, and it was rumored that in some communities, babysitters
snubbed non-set owners.</font></p>

<p class="auto-style1"><font color="#FFFFFF">Optometrists offered special TV watching glasses to
prevent &quot;telestrain&quot; and viewers were advised to shift their gaze when
viewing for long periods of time to prevent eye strain. In studies done at the
time, two-thirds of those polled said they did less reading, and two-thirds did
less visiting. Magazine reading
decreased
25 percent as did patronage in bars
and taverns. Television was known as &quot;the poor-man's theater.&quot;</font></p>

    <p class="auto-style1"><font color="#FFFFFF">Because KPTV was a UHF station, new sets had to be
modified at the factory. Dealers could not keep sets in stock and there were
waiting lists of up to six months. Television sets were expensive by 1952
standards, with costs ranging from two to four hundred dollars. By February 28,
1953, 72,839 sets had been sold in the Portland Area.</font></p>

<p class="auto-style1"><font color="#FFFFFF">Primary coverage of KPTV extended about 20 miles. The
population of Portland was approximately 750,000 in 1952.</font></p>

<p class="auto-style1"><font color="#FFFFFF">Some things haven't changed much since 1952. In November
of that year, Mayer said &quot;Some of the programs are downright improper for
children. I don't let my own watch it too much. Sometimes I have to shut off the
set and chase them out of the house on Saturday afternoon.&quot;</font></p>

<p align="center" class="auto-style3"><font color="#FFFFFF">1952 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION...</font></p>

<p class="auto-style1"><font color="#FFFFFF">Television brought a new political fire to the area with
the first locally broadcast coverage of the Presidential election. In September
1952, KPTV aired Senator Richard Nixon's famous &quot;Checkers&quot; speech.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">
<img border="1" src="pix/eisenhower.jpg" align="right" width="160" height="119" class="auto-style1"><span class="auto-style1">The Presidential election between Dwight Eisenhower and
Adlai Stevenson was November 4, 1952. This was the first election in the greater
Portland area where voters became better acquainted with the candidates through
the medium of television. In the months before the conventions, numerous
candidates gobbled up every spare minute of TV time nationwide. Eisenhower and
Stevenson were booked for 20 nationwide telecasts each before the election. Both
men had excellent television personalities. Ike's first major televised speech
ran overtime, and he was cut off in mid-sentence!</span></font></p>

<p align="center" class="auto-style3"><font color="#FFFFFF">ADVERTISING...</font></p>

<p class="auto-style1"><font color="#FFFFFF">After three weeks, KPTV air time was sold out with local
commercials. No national spots were sold. Eight seconds of air time went for
$17.50, one minute sold for $35 and 52 half-hour programs went for $127.50 each.</font></p>

<p class="auto-style1"><font color="#FFFFFF">Viewer polls showed that 24 percent of viewers preferred
animated cartoon-type commercials. Only one percent preferred the pitchman-type
commercials that advertisers thought would be perfect for the medium.</font></p>

<p align="center" class="auto-style3"><font color="#FFFFFF">NEW CAREERS...</font></p>

<p class="auto-style1"><font color="#FFFFFF">The industry spawned new careers for television engineers
as well as television repairmen. The medium was so new that it was virtually
impossible to hire people trained in the field. Portland bookseller, J.K. Gill
stocked a large selection of technical books on the television service industry.
Set owners were warned not to try to service their sets themselves because of
dangerously high electrical voltage.</font></p>

Portland’s only non-network station, KPTV turned its focus to local
programming, dubbing itself “The Northwest Personality Station.” On-air
talent such as Gene
Brendler, circus clown Rusty Nails, wrestling commentator
Frank Bonnema and sportscaster Jimmy Jones brought Portland viewers a daily dose
of news, information, sports action, features and fun. The decade also witnessed
the arrival of Rod Anders, who became the nation’s longest running
children’s show host, helming <i>The Ramblin’ Rod Cartoon Show </i>for 33
years. The viewers responded, and by 1968, KPTV had become the number one
independent station in the United States.<o:p>
