circuit as an outcome of the meeting of these two men was a natural. The
Governor has had a great interest in the new hospital since its inception and
Riordan, acting as representative of the Storer Broadcasting Company which has a
highly active public service program, was pleased at the opportunity to make
KPTV facilities available to the school.</font></p>
<p class="auto-style3"><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The tremendous benefit to be derived from the use
of television in teaching medicine has already been proven in some of the
hospitals in the East. A million-dollar permanent color TV installation is now
being made a Walter Reed Hospital. One of the greatest advantages to be gained
by the use of TV in teaching is the benefit of close-up observation for a large
group. Before the introduction of TV into the medical field, only a few could be
close enough to view actual surgery or demonstrations in an amphitheatre.</font></p>

negotiated the deal. Hoffman has started converting the former television studio
into office space for design firms such as architects, interior designers and
engineers. The project is named Design Center Portland.</font></p>
<p class="auto-style3"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2">KPTV operator Oregon Television

which will rent for $10 to $12 per square foot per year, should appeal to lots
of small businesses looking for reasonably priced quarters close to downtown.
Besides architects, likely tenants include graphic designers, advertising
agencies and film and video producers. Some space will be occupied by wholesale
showrooms for interior decorators and home furnishings suppliers, he added.</font></p>

Glow</font></b></font></p>

<font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" class="auto-style3">KPTV,
the city's first station, reflects change both in the industry and American
culture<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;And so, let us now
witness the inauguration of television in Portland...&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It happened at exactly 4:30 p.m. on September 20, 1952.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Most Portlanders knew it was coming. For weeks, some could talk of little
else.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none">
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" class="auto-style3">And
so 50 years ago, the mayor, the City Council and the rest of the power elite
watched it together at the Benson Hotel downtown. Meanwhile, shoppers filled the
new Television Headquarters showroom on the sixth floor of Meier &amp; Frank,
while onlookers overflowed electronics and hardware stores, peering through the
windows. Of the lucky few who were equipped to watch at home, many crammed their
living rooms with all the family, friends and neighbors they could possibly
squeeze in.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Then, at the appointed moment, all those screens flickered,
and a station logo took shape in the darkness.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>&quot;Ladies and gentlemen,&quot; came the voice of Herbert Mayer, the
New York industrialist who had, at long last, brought television to Portland.
&quot;Good afternoon.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Sound
and pictures! News and information! World-class entertainment! And you could see
it all, in vividly bluish black-and-white, in the proverbial comfort of your own
living room!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;The historic
moment has arrived,&quot; Mayer sang. Even now, it doesn't seem like an
overstatement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The glowing box of
fun changed the way Americans learned about the world. But it did more than
that. Within a few years of KPTV's first transmission, after TV culture sank its
roots into the bedrock of Oregon and the country, the new medium began to change
the world it brought us. It transformed everything from residential architecture
to language patterns to family relationships and the governance of the nation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Other stations would come to Portland in the next few years. KOIN (6) hit
the air a year later, followed a year after that by the short-lived KLOR (12),
KGW (8) in 1956 and KATU (2) in 1961. KPDX (49) joined the party in 1983.
Together, they filled the local airwaves with the boundless variety of news and
entertainment to which modern viewers have grown accustomed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Along the way, Americans became closet extroverts: eagerly diving into
the lives and travails of others, but only through the front of their TVs, from
the soft confines of their living room sofas.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>None of which surprises historian Jim Cullen. &quot;The history of
popular culture is the history of privatization,&quot; he says. &quot;Movies
took culture into a dark room; TV brought it into private homes. And now the
Internet individualizes the process even more.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Meanwhile, the TV business itself has changed, moving from a
highly regulated industry owned by a legion of mostly small to midsize
corporations, to a realm of massive, multinational corporations governed by a
fraying set of rules that are rarely enforced, even where they still exist.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>In this, KPTV finds itself once again leading the way. Recently purchased
by Meredith Broadcasting, a vast Iowa-based communications concern that already
owned KPDX (49), KPTV is now half of what the TV industry calls a
&quot;duopoly,&quot; a cost-effective setup that allows a single company to run
two stations as if they were one, with a common management, headquarters and
revenue-focused mission.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>To Cullen,
KPTV's journey from newfound civic treasure to cog in a conglomerate may
actually illustrate a larger, even more surprising story in the larger tale:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>&quot;The age of TV is ending.&quot; <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none">
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" class="auto-style3">When
Lenox R. Lohr, president of NBC, visited Portland in February 1937, he didn't
think the TV age was ever going to begin.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;Sound
broadcasting will continue to be popular,&quot; the executive declared, citing
reasons that ranged from the demographic to the technical.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>More than anything, Lohr couldn't wrap his mind around the physical
demands imposed by audiovisual entertainment. As he pointed out, you could
listen to the radio and still do a million other things: cook, clean, shave,
play tiddlywinks, whatever. TV, on the other hand, would pin people down.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>&quot;It will require your absolute, undivided attention!&quot; Lohr
scoffed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Lohr, as it turns out, was
no Amazing Kreskin.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>But then, Kreskin's no Philo T. Farnsworth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Farnsworth, the inventor of the television, was only 14 when the sight of
a freshly plowed grain field inspired him to think about the possibility of
transmitting pictures on radio waves. This is genius stuff, somewhere off on the
fault line between visionary and I-see-dead-people. But it took Farnsworth only
seven years to get from that Idaho wheat field to broadcasting the first-ever
visual image in 1927. He was 21 at the time and on the verge of an extremely
long and unpleasant battle with RCA's president, David Sarnoff, who would have
preferred if one of his staff inventors had come up with the TV, and so he said
one of them had.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>That's a whole
other story, however, and what matters here is that only 20 months after the
skeptical Mr. Lohr's visit to Portland, an experimental video setup called the
Farnsworth Mobile Television Unit drew throngs of excited Portlanders to Meier
&amp; Frank's eighth-floor auditorium.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There,
they were entranced by the sight of local entertainers -- who in actual fact
were in the same room behind a heavy curtain -- cavorting on a rudimentary,
30-image-a-second black-and-white screen. The thrill of turning live
entertainment into blurry TV may seem elusive to us in the 21st century. But it
was such a kick back then that a story in The Oregonian the next morning
reported how taken the crowd was by the video appearance of one Manelouise
MacPherson, a local teen who read &quot;an amusing monologue about
football.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Portlanders weren't
the only Americans hungry for video entertainment. Within months, the Federal
Communications Commission would license commercial stations in New York and
Chicago. Philadelphia followed in 1941. World War II halted the advance of
civilian technology for the next few years, but the peace and prosperity that
arrived in 1945 -- along with a vast, war-honed industrial complex -- ushered
television back into the national fast lane.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The first TV station in the Pacific Northwest, Seattle's KRSC, hit the
air in November 1948. And though the tower on Seattle's Queen Anne Hill was
nearly 200 miles away, some impatient Portlanders erected antennas in their back
yards, hoping to capture the fragments of signal floating on the breeze.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>In Astoria, an enterprising radio engineer named Ed Parsons not only put
up an antenna, but also figured out how to transmit the resulting signal onto a
coaxial cable, which he would feed into the homes of TV-owning neighbors willing
to pay a small monthly fee. Parsons, in other words, was the world's first cable
TV baron.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Meanwhile, Portland's aspiring broadcasters were jockeying
for license approval from the FCC. The Oregonian -- then owner of KGW radio --
earned a license for a KGW-TV station in 1947, but returned it a year later in
order to focus on its newspaper and radio businesses. (The Oregonian's parent
company would eventually be part owner of KOIN, the city's second station,
before selling its stake in the 1970s.) Other entrepreneurs tried to wrest their
own piece of the local TV dial, but by the end of 1948, the FCC, realizing the
13-channel VHF spectrum would soon be overrun with video signals, put a freeze
on licenses until science could figure out a way to expand the dial.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>A process they expected to take a year instead took four. But by the
spring of 1952, the FCC was back in the license-granting business. And in
suburban New Rochelle, N.Y., Herbert Mayer -- the owner of an electronic
equipment company called Empire Coil who had recently expanded into media by
buying a TV station in Cleveland -- decided to stake his next claim to media
baronhood in the Willamette Valley.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none">
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" class="auto-style3">In
the summer of 1952, Mayer arrived in Portland to a hero's welcome. &quot;Mr.
TV!&quot; is what The Oregonian called him, photographing the &quot;dapper&quot;
businessman disembarking from an airplane in the company of Mrs. Mayer and four
of their five children. A few weeks after KPTV started broadcasting, The Journal
weighed in with a full-length profile, (&quot;Portland's New Mayer&quot;) which
lovingly described a &quot;young, high-powered
lawyer-industrialist-showman,&quot; who also happened to be &quot;quick-witted
and ruddy of face.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He was a
canny fellow, too. Once the FCC lifted its freeze on new TV licenses, Mayer
bypassed the scrum of entrepreneurs battling for Portland's VHF frequencies,
focusing his application on the untrammeled UHF dial.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Sure, the new spectrum didn't have the power of the VHF band, and all but
the newest TV sets would have to be equipped with adapters to draw its signal.
But, as Mayer knew, being the first on the air in a TV-starved city could pay
enormous dividends with advertisers and viewers alike. As one nameless RCA exec
told Newsweek a week after KPTV's debut: &quot;The first one gets the gravy. The
second gets nothing.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Awarded
his Portland license in July 1952, Mayer immediately bought an experimental UHF
station built by RCA in Bridgeport, Conn., and had the whole shebang packed up
and shipped west. Days later, he flew out himself to break ground at the Council
Crest site where his 210-foot antenna tower would rise. The ceremony made
headlines in both The Oregonian and The Journal, as did Mayer's prediction of a
November on-air date. Still, the reports neglected to mention the part of Mayor
Dorothy McCullough Lee's speech that unwittingly prompted the crowd's biggest
response.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;She said:
'Television will be Portland's Thanksgiving turkey!' &quot; recalls The
Oregonian's radio and about-to-be TV columnist, Francis Murphy. &quot;That was
met with a moment of silence, then howls of laughter. And she couldn't figure
out why!&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Another thing Lee
didn't know was that Mayer, despite all pronouncements to the contrary, wanted
KPTV to start broadcasting in September. He had already staked out a building on
Southwest 20th Place for his studios and started hiring a staff. Bill Swing, a
recent Reed College alum, was working as a junior manager with the Bonneville
Power Administration when he asked Mayer to give him a job with KPTV's fledgling
news department.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;I made a
pest of myself and showed him I had the fever,&quot; says Swing, who would
bracket a long media career with stints at KPTV, ultimately serving as its news
director. &quot;Besides, most of the experienced radio news guys didn't want to
leave their jobs for such an experimental place.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Gene Phelps, a transmitter engineer who had worked at radio
stations in Minneapolis, discovered exactly how experimental KPTV's setup was
soon after he started his new job Sept. 10 -- less than two weeks before Mayer's
target on-air date of Sept. 20.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;It
was an ongoing training session,&quot; he says of his earliest days in the
small, windowless structure beneath the tower on Council Crest. &quot;No one had
experienced this stuff before. You could say there was doubt we would make the
deadline.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Amazingly,
everything seemed to go according to plan. As the big day approached, Mayer sent
out engraved invitations to an eight-hour bash that would begin with a reception
and lunch at the Multnomah Hotel, continue with a bus trip to the transmitter
building, then climax at a TV-equipped ballroom at the Benson Hotel, where the
assembled VIPs would view the first hours of KPTV's existence while nibbling
catered snacks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Of course, you
didn't have to be invited to Mayer's party to get caught up in the anticipation.
Local appliance stores sold out their inventories of Philcos and RCAs, (most of
which sold in the $300 to $500 range, around $2,000 to $3,400 today) and the
California factory that made UHF adapters was already working around the clock
to keep pace with the orders coming out of Oregon.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>One man who could have used a bit less excitement that Saturday was KPTV
engineer Phelps. Everything looked fine all morning and even when the VIPs came
to tour the transmitter building, he recalls. But then, just as the partygoers
were settling in at the Benson, disaster struck.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>&quot;Whammo!&quot; he says. &quot;It blew the bypass plate capacitator!&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Which is to say, no power. No picture. No TV. This would not be good at
any time, but with less than an hour to go before the station was set to go
live, it was disastrous. Or so it seemed until someone remembered that the RCA
engineers Mayer had brought in from Connecticut to help get the station up and
running had thought to bring a spare capacitator.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>&quot;We were shaking in our boots,&quot; Phelps says. &quot;It was real
touch-and-go.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Then 4:30 came, and all over the city the screens flickered

<font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" class="auto-style3">Mayer's
opening speech gave way to an 18-minute documentary about KPTV's transmitter
titled, &quot;Success Hill.&quot; Then the real fun started with NBC's &quot;All
Star Revue,&quot; a live music-and-comedy show hosted that week by Jimmy Durante,
with guest stars Margaret Truman and Phil Harris.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>An old-school vaudeville entertainer with a live band behind him, Durante
hoofed, sang and cracked jokes about pretty girls, booze and the size of his
nose. He also made plenty of cracks about the coming presidential contest
between Adlai Stevenson and Dwight Eisenhower, particularly when Truman -- the
outgoing president's 28-year-old daughter -- was on the stage.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>&quot;This does not constitute an endorsement of any political
party!&quot; he mugged after giving Truman a welcoming kiss. She showed off her
own political button: Durante for President.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>All of this was probably lost on Republican vice presidential candidate
Richard Nixon, whose weekend visit to Portland was all but eclipsed by the
fanfare for KPTV. And maybe that was fine with the candidate, then neck-deep in
charges that he had misused $18,000 worth of political contributions. On the
verge of being booted from his spot on Eisenhower's ticket, Nixon took to his
hotel room, where he apparently drafted a large part of the &quot;Checkers&quot;
speech that would save his career -- and become the first political broadcast to
be shown on KPTV three days later.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>On
Oct. 1, the day KPTV started regular programming, NBC broadcast a 15-minute
feature called &quot;Tribute to KPTV, Portland, Ore.&quot; The show -- set at
the imposing execu-desk of NBC president Sarnoff (Philo Farnsworth's corporate
nemesis) -- featured Paul Walker, the chairman of the FCC and Mayer's
14-year-old daughter, Sandra, who presented Sarnoff with a ceremonial scroll
celebrating &quot;all NBC has done for television.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Young Miss Mayer's hyperbole was just a warm-up for Sarnoff, who compared
KPTV's journey into the UHF spectrum to Lewis and Clark's mapping of America's
Western frontier.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;Few feats
of exploration excel this in romantic interest,&quot; Sarnoff declared.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Still, TV's earliest years did project the wide-open feeling of a new
horizon. Working regularly from his office at KPTV, Mayer controlled everything
from programming to the placement of photographs in the hallway. Given no
accepted model of how a TV station should be run, Mayer and his eager young
staff re-invented their station from week to week.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Aside from the evenings, which they plugged with network shows, they
filled KPTV's broadcast day with local shows that ranged from typical '50s fare
(Heck Harper, the singing cowboy; the &quot;High Time&quot; afternoon dance
show) to provincial (the &quot;Stars of Tomorrow&quot; talent show and the
&quot;Dogtails&quot; missing pet show) to just plain odd (the Tarantula Ghoul
skits before &quot;Mystery Theater&quot;).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>And while local news anchors mostly sat immobile, reading news stories to
the camera or talking over silent (and usually day-old) footage shot in the
field, they also had opportunities to stretch.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>&quot;I'd say, 'Let's put Eleanor Roosevelt on the air when she's in
town!' and Mayer would say, 'Sure, OK,' &quot; Swing recalls. &quot;It was like
a mom-and-pop operation. The owner was on the premises. He hired at least half
of the people there. And when he sold (to George Storer in 1955, who sold soon
after to the Chris Craft media company, which owned the station until the late
'90s) that marked the end of the entrepreneurial era in Portland TV.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The price for Mayer's station? A then-astonishing $10 million.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>But even as Mayer left the scene, and KPTV switched affiliations from NBC
to ABC and then to independent status, it maintained a reputation for innovation
and commercial success.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In the
'50s, KPTV was the first in Oregon to broadcast in color (although it didn't
provide regular color programming until 1964). Those jokey skits that led off
the &quot;House of Horror&quot; movies in the '50s and '60s not only made local
celebrities out of Milton and Tarantula Ghoul (portrayed by local actors John
Hillsbury and Suzanne Waldron) but also invented a style of presentation that
would soon be replicated around the country.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>KPTV aired live regional sports events long before that became a national
standard, and even when the station aired repeats of network shows, its strategy
of scheduling them five days a week -- strip programming, as it is now known --
eventually became an industry standard. <o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none">
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" class="auto-style3">Even
from the beginning, TV could cater to every whim and appetite. Ed Sullivan had
everything from rock 'n' roll to opera to plate-spinners. &quot;Dragnet&quot;
established a cop show format that would be echoed and adapted over the years by
&quot;Adam 12,&quot; &quot;Starsky and Hutch,&quot; &quot;Hill Street
Blues&quot; and &quot;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation.&quot; Family sitcoms
ranged from &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; to &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot; to &quot;The
Simpsons.&quot; &quot;The Smothers Brothers,&quot; &quot;MASH&quot; and
&quot;The West Wing&quot; blended in a social conscience, playing off the epic
events -- wars, the assassinations of President Kennedy, the Rev. Martin Luther
King Jr. and Sen. Robert Kennedy, the explosion of the Challenger space shuttle
and the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001 -- that now play as TV drama,
complete with titles, specialized graphics and promo reels.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>At the same time, Portland's stations defined their own corner of the
broadcast world. According to Scot Roskelley, who wrote a thesis on the city's
TV industry as a University of Portland graduate student in the mid- '80s, the
stations followed distinct paths into the modern media marketplace.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>KOIN, the city's second station, had been first plotted in the late 1940s
by Chicago department store tycoon Marshall Field. But he lost enthusiasm during
the FCC license freeze and sold his interest to an assistant, C. Howard Lane,
who teamed up with local businessman Ted Gamble and Oregonian owner S.I.
Newhouse (who would sell his interest in 1977) to take over KOIN radio and work
on getting the TV license they scored in 1953.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>On the air slightly more than a year after KPTV, CBS affiliate KOIN
emphasized news coverage and made a splash with detailed reports on local
weather -- a novelty in those days. Eager to cultivate a high-end, sophisticated
audience, the station not only refused to accept local ads for laxatives and
hemorrhoid medicine, but also employed a live orchestra to play an hour of music
every weekday at noon.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Lane, who
was repulsed by the notion of seeing laxative ads at the dinner table, loved
owning one of the few orchestra-equipped local stations in the country.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>&quot;At the affiliate meetings, no one could believe we did this,&quot;
he told Roskelley.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Portland's next
station, KLOR, signed on as an ABC affiliate in March 1955. The only station to
be owned locally (its owners included Jack Meier of Meier &amp; Frank), its
owners came up with the KLOR call letters hoping to position the station for the
coming era of all-color broadcasting. But the station couldn't find a foothold
in the local marketplace, and ABC abandoned the channel in 1956. KLOR went dark
three years later, surrendering its VHF slot to KPTV.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>KGW, which hit the air at the end of 1956, was far more successful. This
was in large part thanks to its Seattle-based owner, Dorothy Bullitt, who
invested loads of money in equipment and talent, including a news team whose
core players, including future Gov. Tom McCall, anchor/news director Richard
Ross, sports director Doug La Mear and weatherman Jack Capell, stayed together
(except for McCall, who left to run for secretary of state) until 1975.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Bullitt also made her station a hub of progressive politics, hiring women
and African Americans when integrated workplaces were still a rarity. She also
encouraged the station to air political commentaries, including anti-war
editorials that sparked controversy, and earned national coverage, in the late
'60s.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Launched by the Seattle-based Fisher Communications group
(the only original station owner left in Portland), KATU arrived in 1961 as one
of the nation's then-few independent stations. Though the station -- which would
eventually take the ABC affiliation from KPTV -- struggled to find a commercial
niche, it hit its stride in the early '70s with a wide selection of local shows
ranging from hard news (&quot;Town Hall,&quot; hosted for years by local
attorney Jack Faust) to feature-heavy chat shows including &quot;AM
Northwest,&quot; which still exists, &quot;Two at Four&quot; and &quot;Faces and
Places.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The next generation
of stations, including KPDX (49) and KPXG (22), came into being years later,
when the cable revolution had already transformed the landscape of the world
KPTV and its immediate competitors defined. Surrounded on the cable by a hundred
other broadcast options, the average local station is a flyspeck, a conduit to
the network programming that attracts a smaller number of viewers each year.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>A new media universe To adjust to the new landscape, and to make up for
the once-dominant stations' loss of market share, the FCC has relaxed or
eliminated a legion of laws that once governed industry in the public's air. No
longer required to satisfy the needs of children, local interests or opposing
voices, station owners are also free to collect stations, building chains that
stretch from coast to coast.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>KPTV, for example, is now a relatively small part of the
Iowa-based Meredith Broadcasting's media machine. Operating out of KPDX's
Beaverton complex, miles away from the downtown core that cradled it for five
decades, KPTV has shed many longtime employees along with whatever affection
they might have felt for their company's history and traditions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>KPTV's management doesn't even plan to have a party to mark the station's
golden anniversary.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Calling from her office in Beaverton, Teresa Burgess, the
executive Meredith Broadcasting installed this spring to run its Portland
duopoly, said the switch in ownership (from short-term owner Fox Broadcasting)
made it all but impossible to bang the drums about the station's 50th birthday.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>&quot;The focus had to be on promoting the (Fox/UPN) affiliation
switch,&quot; she says. And even if that weren't going on, the modern-day
dynamics of broadcasting just don't include an emphasis on civic milestones.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>KPTV will air an hourlong anniversary show Sunday night, along with
occasional historical vignettes that will pop up every so often until the end of
the year. The station has renewed its emphasis on local news (although Meredith
used a duopoly loophole in the FCC's local news requirements to ax KPDX's news
team) but the sort of locally made, locally focused programs that Herb Mayer,
Dorothy Bullitt and their contemporaries loved have gone the way of the bunny
ears.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;The business model has
shifted to where local programming is no longer cost-effective,&quot; Burgess
explains.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The business model,
represented by the numbers marching constantly across the lower edge of the TV
screen on the cable news channels, have become the heartbeat not just of
industry but of culture. And critics contend that society marches to that rhythm
now, a collection of viewers with paper-thin patience and a sense of adventure
that extends about as far as the upper reaches of the cable. Most often, they
say, these viewers are satisfied to stay home and let the TV lay it all out for
them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Did TV do this, using its
cathode rays like a kind of alien tractor beam? Or is this what the culture
always yearned to become -- a nation of individuals both united and divided by a
river of constant information? And it might keep right on happening, the river
flowing through the Internet, into the computer, into the digital chips
implanted behind everyone's left ear.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For
now it's impossible to say. But it will surely become clear someday. And when it
does, it will just as certainly end up on TV.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
