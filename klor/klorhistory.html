      <br>
      Proposed sale of Portland television station KLOR to George Haggarty, 
    Detroit attorney, was announced Thursday by Henry A. White, president of 
    Oregon Television, Inc.</div>
	<p class="auto-style3">Terms of the purchase, White said, are subject to approval by the FCC.</p>
      <p class="auto-style3">KLOR, channel 12, has been in operation in Portland since March, 1955, 
      when it was founded by Jack Meier, William A. Healy, Eberly Thompson and 
      Robert L. Sabin as co-owners.</p>
      <p class="auto-style3">Stock sought by Haggarty of the independent station, formerly an ABC 
      network outlet, is currently held by the founders and the U.S. National 
      bank in trust for the Hunt Malarkey estate.</p>
      <p class="auto-style3">John Kendall, attorney for the transaction, said release of the terms 
      was contingent upon approval of the FCC, a matter which he estimated would 
      take 30 to 60 days.</p>
      <p class="auto-style3">Studios are at 915 N.E. Davis street, with power and transmitter 
      located on Healy heights.</p>
      <p class="auto-style3">Haggarty, who left Portland for Detroit Wednesday night plans no change 
      in the personnel or policy of the station, White said.</p>
      <p class="auto-style3">He is expected to return to Portland on approval of the transaction by 
      the FCC.&nbsp;</p>

	<b>THE FINAL FAREWELL</b></div>
	<p class="auto-style3">KLOR went dark at the end of the broadcast day on April 30, 1957.&nbsp; 
      When viewers tuned into channel 12 the following morning, it would be to 
      the sounds and shows of KPTV. While her time on the air had been short, it 
      was not without an impact on the viewing community. Many of those people 
      closest to the business knew that television in Portland would never be 
      quite the same.</p>
      <p class="auto-style3">Publisher and Editor of TV-Radio Prevue Magazine, Jack Hurd, wrote this 
      column, shortly after KLOR's demise.</p>
      <p><b><em>IN MEMORIUM:</em></b><em><br>
      <br>
      Rest in peace, Portland's only home owned television station.<br>
      <br>
      It was a noble experiment: An independent TV station depending only on its 
      own talent and ingenuity to gain an audience. Talent, Ingenuity and Home 
      Ownership: three factors which, properly combined, could have made 
      Portland a lively center of America's most talked of industry.&nbsp;</em></p>
      <p> <em>For a while it seemed to be working out fine. KLOR-TV had the talent, 
      the shows. Their production people, the finest crew on the west coast, 
      according to many advertisers, had the ingenuity. Then one link in the 
      chain broke: Home ownership. It seems that only people from Syracuse, 
      Detroit, Seattle and such, have faith in the future of Portland.&nbsp;</em></p>
      <p> <em>In deference to their place in this community, let's not name the 
      former owners of KLOR who sold us out. Let them be namelessly condemned 
      for selling out the ideals and hopes of all of us who felt proud at being 
      associated with a home owned station; for selling out to the simple 
      expedient of punching a button to bring In shows instead of using brains, 
      talent and ingenuity to send them out. This column cannot hurt them, they 
      just made a couple of million bucks. More than you and I will ever see, 
      probably.&nbsp;</em></p>
      <p> <em>But this column can, with reflected bitterness, project the animosity 
      of sponsors and performers, of creators and artisans, who will either 
      never be seen or heard from again in this market, or who will have their 
      activities severely curtailed. Many sponsors whose budgets could only 
      afford KLOR and who got results from KLOR will never again be able to 
      afford TV until some future persons unknown have the guts to put on an 
      independent station. We personally know sponsors whose profits were based 
      largely on the results gained from KLOR programs and spots, so let's not 
      hear that inability to produce results was the reason behind KLOR's sale 
      and merger.<br>
      <br>
      Personally I'm tired of Portland being a satellite to New York and 
      Hollywood. I hope someone with a million bucks and a Portland address 
      agrees with me and puts an independent station on the air soon. I'll watch 
      it. How about you?</em></p>
