show,
      Nate Cohn would have
      to
      talk in terms of thousands. In its 30th sponsored year, this outstanding
program---which is currently carried over
KLOR, Channel 12 each Saturday at
6:30---has appeared on most Portland radio stations as well as network outlets. During that time, the show has received well in excess of a quarter of a million fan letters. For 15 Years, the program was regularly carried on
KGW
      [</span><span class="auto-style2">radio;
      After
      1950,
      the
      show
      aired
      on
      KEX
      radio.</span>]<br class="auto-style1">
<br class="auto-style1">
	  <span class="auto-style1">For many years, the show was presented in the window of the Star Furniture Company. However, police found it increasingly difficult to control the traffic-stopping throngs that gathered in the vicinity, and for this reason the show was moved to the station studios. Even then, eager crowds spilled out into hallways and stairways.</span><br class="auto-style1">
<br class="auto-style1">
	  <span class="auto-style1">Stars of Tomorrow is actually the result of the thinking and planning of three men. Originated by Uncle
Nate,
who
has acted as MC from the initial program, the show is sponsored by the Star Furniture Company, owned by Harry Zavin and Dave Light.</span><br class="auto-style1">
<br class="auto-style1">
	  <span class="auto-style1">Although Uncle Nate loves all his kids without partiality, he is naturally proud of the ones who have made the big-time. Kay St.
Germain, Jane Powell and Nora Maxtin are only a few of his
protégés who have skyrocketed to fame and fortune.</span><br class="auto-style1">

      <img border="1" src="localpix/stars02.jpg" width="300" height="364" align="right" class="auto-style1"></span><span class="auto-style1">It is only natural that Uncle Nate should feel a profound sympathy for the wide-eyed youngsters who hope an appearance on his show may spring-board them to eventual stardom. When most kids were playing cowboy and Indian, he traveled the
Sullivan-Considine circuit as Harold Hoff, "The Boy Wonder." During those sometime meager years, he developed a sure showman's instinct for spotting a "comer." However, even Uncle Nate can make an occasional mistake, which he freely admits. Here's how he himself describes one such error of judgment: "He was a Franklin High School student, about 16 or 17 years old, not too good looking, and he said he was a singer who accompanied himself on the piano. When the audition was over, I informed the boy that I'd be glad to have him appear on the show, but that didn't mean he was the greatest thing I'd ever heard " I explained that his voice was only fair,
that his piano playing was about average, and that I wasn't too impressed with his style of singing. However, I did like his personality and his desire to join our
Stars
of Tomorrow. Then I asked,
'What's your name, son?'</span><br class="auto-style1">
<br class="auto-style1">
	  <span class="auto-style1">"His smile
was genuinely warm as he shook my hand and answered, 'Thanks for everything, Uncle
Nate.
'My name is Johnny
Ray'.&quot;</span><br class="auto-style1">

      Auditorium
      that
      night
      (the
      concert
      had
      been
      sold
      out
      for
      weeks
      and
      no
      tickets
      were
      available)
      and
      I
      would
      be
      his
      back
      stage
      guest
      for
      the
      concert.
      Obviously,
      I
      did
      as
      I
      was
      told
      and
      met
      Myron
      Floren,
      the
      Lennon
      Sisters,
      Alice
      Lon,
      among
      the
      other
      regulars
      on
      his
      show.
      After
      intermission,
      Welk
      invited
      me
      on
      stage,
      introduced
      me
      to
      the
      audience
      and
      handed
      me
      his
      baton
      to
      direct
      the
      band
      playing
      &quot;South
      Rampart
      Street
      Parade.&quot;
      To
      this
      day,
      it
      remains
      a
      highlight
      of
      my
      career
      as
      a
      professional
      accordionist
      and
      entertainer.&nbsp;</font></p>

      the

      these

      <span style="font-style: italic" class="auto-style1">My family owned the 
      Star Furniture Company which sponsored Stars of Tomorrow and which 
      employed Nate Cohn as our sales manager.&nbsp; Nate kept a regular stock of 
      Johnnie Ray pictures which he passed out to customers who visited the 
      store primarily to see Nate.&nbsp; However, once they were in the store he, and 
      our sales staff, talked them into buying furniture.&nbsp; Though I wasn’t alive 
      at the time, my grandfather told me that when the show broadcast from our 
      store window on 4th avenue the crowds would be so large that traffic would 
      be stopped on 4th.&nbsp; Because of this, the city council passed an ordinance 
      forbidding live entertainment in store windows, and that is why the show 
      moved into a studio.&nbsp; I do remember visiting Nate and the show in the 
      mid-1950s to watch the Mouseketeers, from the Mickey Mouse club.&nbsp; My 
      siblings and cousins and I got to meet several of the Mousketeers who were 
      about our ages.&nbsp; This was the highlight of my 1950s and probably of my 
      brother’s and sisters’ also.&nbsp; My father told me that after the transition 
      to television, Stars of Tomorrow was, at one point, the longest running 
      show on radio and television.&nbsp; It eventually might have been eclipsed by 
      the Ted Mack amateur hour, and it was surely bested by the radio 
      broadcasts of the Metropolitan Opera, but at one time Nate held the 
      record.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></font></p>
