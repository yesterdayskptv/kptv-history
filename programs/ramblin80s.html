      <p>&quot;If it ain't broke, don't fix it.&quot;&nbsp; That seemed to be
      the axiom that <i>The Ramblin Rod Cartoon Show</i> lived by in the 1980s.</p>
      <p>Other than some noticeable upgrades in KPTV's on-air equipment,
      evidenced by fancier graphics and funny bumpers (leading into and out of
      segments) Ramblin' Rod continued to entertain children much as he had for
      the previous two decades.</p>
      <p>Already popular with children in the Portland area, Rod increased his
      reach by taking the show on the road.&nbsp; Throughout the '80s, <i>The
      Ramblin' Rod Cartoon Show </i>visited cities across Oregon and Southwest
      Washington, attending county and state fairs and other local events.<b><font size="4"><br>

      <p>Eighty skinny arms wave and 40 tiny voices scream out their welcome to one of Portland television's longest-running local programs, "The Ramblin' Rod Show."<br>
      <br>
      It is 5 p.m. in a cavernous studio at KPTV, Channel 12. The 40 excited little boys and girls have been ushered onto the rows of bleachers by floor director Lois Karas. Some are mere toddlers. They are dragged along by their older brothers and sisters. Many clutch dolls, most of the Cabbage Patch Kids variety.<br>
      <br>
      The show is being taped for the following morning. The show actually is aired from 7:30 to 8:30 a.m. each day.<br>
      <br>
      Five days a week for 20 years, Rod Anders has become Ramblin' Rod, the smiling, genial host for one of the nation's last remaining kiddies programs. He's 51, although he looks younger, but Anders has no thought of giving up his show.</p>

      <p>"Retirement? That's a dirty word," said Anders, his coat glistening with dozens of the thousands of buttons he has acquired during two decades of joking with children and showing cartoons.<br>
      <br>
      He was born in Portland, not too far from the KPTV studios, which adjoin the west edge of Civic Stadium. He got his start in broadcasting as a disc jockey on old radio station KPOJ. That is where he started singing and plucking his guitar.<br>
      <br>
      "It was 20 years ago this August that Bob Adkins, who was known as Addie Bobkins on the air, quit KPTV," Anders said. "I came over and applied for his job, got it, and I'm still here."<br>
      <br>
      After director Karas, a Fort Vancouver High School graduate and daughter of a school administrator here, gets the kids calmed down and at ease with some simple exercises, Anders takes over. He moves among the children, microphone in hand, joking with this one, asking questions of another.<br>
      <br>
      His specialty is a handshake that makes the thin arm of the boy or girl undulate like seaweed in the strong surf. This always is good for a laugh.</p>

      <p>As he wends his way up and down the rows of children, Anders uses the time-tested gags that have broken up his young. audience for two decades. "Is this your husband," he asks a 7-year-old. girl, pointing to the
      gum-chewing boy sitting next to her. (No. Giggle, giggle, giggle.)<br>
      <br>
      Anders' current favorite story concerns a Battle Ground boy, Tony Sahli. "When
      we had the freezing weather and silver thaw around Christmas, Tony was the only kid to show up," Anders said. "Somehow, he made it all the way in from Battle Ground. So we put the show on, just he and
      I. We called it the Ramblin' Tony show. He was terrific. He grabbed the mike and away we went."<br>
      <br>
      Usually, about 40 boys and girls show up for each program, ranging in age from 2 to 12. At one time, reservations had to be made a year in advance to get on the show. Now, about one month's leeway is required.<br>
      <br>
      Anders laughs when he is asked if working with 40 giggling children on camera every day doesn't just about drive him nuts. "I love it," he responds. "Each one is an individual. You can practically see them blooming."</p>

      <p>Since his show is 20 years old, Anders now is entertaining the sons and daughters of the boys and girls who appeared on his show over the years. He would not be surprised if some third-generation guests might not be popping up before too long.<br>
      <br>
      "Kids recognize me on the street and run up to say hello, as if they have known me all their lives," he explained. "I suppose, in a way they have."<br>
      <br>
      Although children's shows of this format have largely disappeared in this more sophisticated age,
      <i>Ramblin' Rod</i> always has enjoyed good ratings over the years. "Even when we ran up against 'Sesame Street' head-to-head, our ratings didn't seem to suffer," he said.<br>
      <br>
      There is a serious side to Anders, too. He is moderator of Channel 12's Saturday program,
      <i><a href="12morning.html" target="_blank">12 in the Morning</a></i>, in which he interviews guests on all sorts of subjects. "I can talk about just any subject you can think of," he said.<br>
      <br>
      Anders also is proud of his role as moderator of the <i> Easter Seals</i> and
      <i> Muscular Dystrophy</i> telethons which run on Channel 12. "We've got our 10th or 11th one coming up in April," he said.<br>
      <br>
      As if that weren't enough, Anders also is the KPTV staff announcer, as well as the man who pitches used cars on screen for Beaverton Toyota.<br>

      &quot;Ramblin'

      is

      &quot;A

      the

      needs
      to

      him.
      &quot;It's
      like
      a

      he
      reasons.
      &quot;You
      don't
      ask
      about

      life,
      what

      he
      is
      in

      life,
      do
      you?
      It
      doesn't
      have
      anything
      to
      do
      with
      how
      well
      he
      does
      his
      job.</p>
      <p>&quot;I'm
      sharing
      myself

      home
      life
      to
      everyone,&quot;
      Anders
      emphasizes.
      &quot;There
      are
      facts
      I
      wouldn't
      like
      people
      to

      I
      don't

      lot
      more
      about
      who
      I
      am
      by
      doing
      television.&quot;</p>
      <p>The
      native
      Oregonian,
      who
      turns
      50
      on
      Nov.
      26,
      came
      to
      television
      from
      radio.
      His
      first
      job,
      at
      17,
      was
      as
      a
      ballad
      singer
      for
      a
      small
      Tillamook
      radio
      station.
      From
      1958
      to
      1962,
      Anders
      worked
      at
      KFLW
      in
      Klamath
      Falls,
      KUIK
      in
      Hillsboro
      and
      KXL
      in
      Portland.
      From
      1962
      to
      1964,
      he
      anchored
      a
      morning
      show
      on
      The
      Oregon
      Journal's
      radio
      station,
      KPOJ.</p>

      Since
      1964,
      Anders
      has
      been
      star
      of
      the
      continuously
      popular
      kids'show,
      &quot;Ramblin'
      Rod.&quot;
      He
      can
      also
      be
      seen
      Saturday
      mornings
      on

      affairs
      program
      &quot;12

      he
      can
      be
      heard
      as
      the
      voice
      behind
      KPTV,
      announcing
      upcoming
      programs
      and
      lead-ins
      to
      commercial
      breaks
      (&quot;Theeee
      Movie&quot;).</p>
      <p>That's
      not
      all.
      Anders
      regularly
      turns
      up
      in
      local
      commercials,
      and
      telethons
      for
      muscular
      dystrophy
      and
      the
      Easter
      Seals.</p>
      <p>This
      man
      is
      not
      exactly
      hiding
      in
      the
      woodwork.
      Nevertheless,
      he
      maintains,
      &quot;I
      am
      different
      from
      the
      average
      show
      biz
      creature.
      I
      don't
      need
      the
      attention.
      It's
      fine,
      I
      enjoy
      it
      very
      much;
      the
      adoration
      of
      young
      children
      is
      rewarding.
      But
      I
      don't
      feel
      like
      I
      need
      it.&quot;</p>
      <p>He
      doesn't
      think
      it
      ironic
      that
      he's
      chosen
      a
      profession
      that
      keeps
      him
      in
      the
      public
      eye,
      yet
      he
      steadfastly
      shuns
      publicly
      sharing
      who
      he
      is.
      &quot;I'll
      tell
      you:
      I'm
      going
      to
      be
      50
      soon,
      and
      I've
      guarded
      my
      life
      pretty
      well
      up
      to
      now.
      I
      play
      myself
      on
      television
      --
      pretty
      much.
      I'm
      not
      an
      actor.
      As
      much
      as
      a
      person
      can
      call
      himself
      a
      personality,
      I'm
      a
      personality.</p>
      <p>&quot;The
      mistakes
      I've
      made,
      I've
      made
      like
      anybody
      else.&quot;
      Then
      he
      makes
      it
      clear
      that
      he
      does
      not
      want
      to
      talk
      about
      -
      or
      have
      printed
      -
      biographical
      information
      regarding
      marriage
      and
      children.</p>

      Don't
      you

      everyone

      say
      that
      if
      they
      were
      being
      honest
      with
      themselves?&quot;
      As
      though
      he's
      given
      away
      too
      much
      about
      himself,
      Anders
      hastily
      adds,
      &quot;Now,
      you
      put
      that
      down
      in
      print
      and
      people
      will
      say,
      'He
      must
      not
      be
      a
      nice

      That's
      not

      Or
      people
      will
      say,
      'He's
      not
      a
      loving
      person.'
      That's
      not
      true,
      either.&quot;</p>
      <p>So
      what
      kind
      of
      person
      is
      he?</p>
      <p>I'd
      say
      someone
      who
      knew
      me
      well
      would
      say,
      'He's
      definitely

      &quot;</p>
      <p>And
      what
      would
      Anders
      say
      of
      himself?</p>
      <p>&quot;I'd
      say
      I'm
      concerned
      about
      things
      taking
      place
      in
      the
      world.
      Also,
      I'm
      fairly
      active.
      Life
      is
      short

      If
      we

      fill
      it
      with
      things
      we
      enjoy,
      it'll
      be
      a
      richer
      life
      and
      we'll
      be
      better
      qualified
      to
      do
      things
      later
      on.&quot;</p>
      <p>Anders

      he

      <p>&quot;Life
      is
      challenging.
      A
      children's
      show
      is
      definitely
      challenging.
      If
      that's

      done,
      that
      I've
      done
      it
      reasonably
      well.
      I
      don't

      that
      has
      me

      do
      more.
      If
      anything,&quot;
      Anders
      chuckles,
      &quot;I'd
      try
      to
      get
      out

      simply

      &quot;How

      do,

      I

      He

      a
      few
      of

      -
      he
      will
      receive
      others
      during
      the

      &quot;One
      of
      the
      things
      we
      do
      here
      every

      is
      check
      smiles,&quot;
      he
      announces,
      sucking
      in
      a
      breath
      and
      donning
      a
      cartoon
      grin.
      His
      audience
      has
      no
      idea
      that
      he
      is
      been

      routine,
      or
      something
      similar,
      for
      18
      years.
      Thirty-nine
      tots
      smile
      back.</p>
      <p>The
      taping
      commences
      without
      fanfare.
      With
      the
      aid
      of
      &quot;Auntie&quot;
      Lois
      Karas,
      the
      floor
      director,
      Anders
      tapes
      several
      segments
      that
      will
      be
      edited
      to
      sandwich
      cartoons
      for
      the
      next
      day's
      broadcast.
      The
      children
      are
      shown
      only
      one
      cartoon
      during
      taping.</p>
      <p>When
      their

      says,

      cartoon.
      Here
      we

      the

      at

      <p>The
      rest
      of
      the
      time,
      they
      fidget
      under
      the
      hot
      lights
      and
      direct
      their
      attention
      to
      Anders,
      or
      the
      cameras,
      or
      the
      parents.
      He
      doesn't
      captivate
      them,
      nor
      do
      they
      seem
      to
      captivate
      him.
      During
      taping
      breaks,
      Anders
      walks
      off
      the
      set
      and
      shows
      no
      interest
      in
      talking
      with
      the
      children.
      When
      the
      hour-long
      production
      is
      over,
      Anders
      offers
      no
      enthusiastic
      farewells.
      Still,
      when
      they
      find
      him
      standing
      in
      the
      hall,
      the
      kids
      crowd
      around
      their
      hero.
      He
      appears
      like
      a
      mammoth,
      mountainous
      island,
      unmoved
      by
      the
      lapping
      sea.</p>
      <p>The
      children
      don't
      seem
      to
      sense
      Anders'
      aloofness.
      They
      look
      to
      him
      as
      a
      friend,
      he
      believes.
      They
      seem
      to
      feel
      safe
      with
      him,
      perhaps
      because
      he's
      not
      overly
      interested
      in
      getting
      to
      know
      them
      and
      at
      the
      same
      time
      he's
      by
      no
      means
      unfriendly
      or
      threatening.
      Whatever
      the
      reason,
      &quot;Ramblin'
      Rod&quot;
      continues
      to
      dominate
      the
      7:30-8:30
      a.m.
      ratings,
      and
      generation
      after
      generation
      considers
      it
      a
      status
      symbol
      to
      have
      an
      autographed
      picture
      of
      the
      cartoon
      host
      hanging
      on
      their
      wall.</p>
      <p>To
      Anders,
      that's
      as
      close
      as
      he
      wants
      to
      get
      with
      his
      public.</p>
