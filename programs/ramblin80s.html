      &quot;It's
      like

      he
      reasons.
      &quot;You

      His

      &quot;I'll

      I
      play
      myself
      on

      --
      pretty
      much.
      I'm
      not

      or

      He
      doesn't
      captivate

      nor
      do
      they
      seem
      to
      captivate
      him.
      During
      taping
      breaks,
      Anders
      walks
      off
      the

      shows
      no

      offers
      no
      enthusiastic
      farewells.
      Still,
      when
      they
      find
      him
      standing
      in
      the
      hall,
      the
      kids
      crowd
      around
      their
      hero.
      He
      appears
      like
      a
      mammoth,
      mountainous
      island,
      unmoved
      by
      the
      lapping
      sea.</p>
      <p class="auto-style12">The
      children
      don't
      seem
      to
      sense
      Anders'
      aloofness.
      They
      look
      to
      him
      as
      a
      friend,
      he
      believes.
      They
      seem
      to
      feel
      safe
      with
      him,
      perhaps
      because
      he's
      not
      overly
      interested
      in
      getting
      to
      know
      them
      and
      at
      the
      same
      time
      he's
      by
      no
      means
      unfriendly
      or
      threatening.
      Whatever
      the
      reason,
      &quot;Ramblin'
      Rod&quot;
      continues
      to
      dominate
      the
      7:30-8:30
      a.m.
      ratings,
      and
      generation
      after
      generation
      considers
      it
      a
      status
      symbol
      to
      have
      an
      autographed
