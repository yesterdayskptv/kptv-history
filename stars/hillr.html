<p><font size="2" face="Arial">For some, giving is the most important part of
the day. Such is the case with Rod Hill, who can be seen giving reliable weather
reports every weeknight on The 10 O’Clock News. When he’s not on the
Oregon’s 12 Weather Deck, Rod is using his certificates from both the American
Meteorological Society and the National Weather Association to give area
students the basics of weather science and how to predict it. Rod came to
Oregon’s 12 in the spring of 1999 after spending four years as staff
meteorologist at WCPO in Cincinnati. He has his Bachelor of Arts degree in
TV/Film Communications from the University of Missouri and a certificate in
Broadcast Meteorology from Mississippi State University. In 1999, The National
Association of Television Arts and Sciences honored him with the Emmy award for
&quot;Best Weathercaster&quot; in the Northwest, and the Associated Press named
him &quot;Best Weathercaster&quot; in 2000.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Rod gives whatever is left of his free time to
his two dogs, a Labrador and a Chow.</font></p>
