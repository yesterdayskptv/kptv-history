with Rick Meyers at
KATU.</font></p>

general assignment reporter with an emphasis on the entertainment industry.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial">In 1979 she began working at
KHJ, the
RKO-owned
radio station in Los Angeles.&nbsp; While there, one of her documentaries on the

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">Kim took on a different aspect of broadcasting
when, in 1981, she became co-owner of KCRF radio in Lincoln City, Oregon.&nbsp;
Starting the station from the ground up, Kim wore many hats, including
advertising sales and news reporting.</font></p>

KPTV, Oregon's 12 and has remained a fixture at the news anchor position ever
