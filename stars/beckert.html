<font color="black" size="2" face="Arial">Tim Becker started anchoring sports at
Oregon’s 12 in January of 1997.</font>
<p><font color="black" size="2" face="Arial">Television careers run through in
Tim’s family like the Blazers on a fast-break. Tim has a brother who is a news
reporter in Charlotte, NC, a sister-in-law who is an anchor also in Charlotte,
another sister-in-law is a documentary producer in San Francisco!</font>
<p><font color="black" size="2" face="Arial">Born in Asia, and raised there
until the age of 12 when his family moved to East Wenatchee, WA, Tim eventually
attended Pacific Lutheran University.</font>
<p><font color="black" size="2" face="Arial">An avid skier, Tim’s career has
almost always kept him near the mountains. He anchored sportscasts at KRDV in
Medford for five years before taking a job in Florida…but Florida’s lack of
ski slopes eventually had Tim looking back to the Northwest. Salt Lake City
brought the promise of untracked powder on the slopes. Tim took a sabbatical
from television, and drove a ski-bus for a short time. The best part of the job,
according to Tim, was the free ski-pass. In July of 1994, Tim took a job with
KOMO in Seattle, just as the roofing tiles in the Kingdome started to fall, and
the Seahawks appeared to be moving to Los Angeles.</font>
<p><font color="black" size="2" face="Arial">&quot;It seems like covering sports
up in Seattle was more about politics and everything else but the games,&quot;
remarks Tim. &quot;It’ll be nice to be working in a city where by-in-large the
teams will be sticking around for a while.&quot;</font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font color="black" size="2">Tim won a national IRIS award
nomination for &quot;Revenge of the Siskiyous,&quot; a half-hour program
covering a mountain bike race in Southern Oregon, an Oregon High School Coaches
Association Prep Sports Media Person of the Year award, and several Associated
Press awards for sports reporting. </font><!-- story ends here -->
