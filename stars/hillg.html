<p><font face="Arial"><b>Gary Hill</b><br>
<font size="2"><i>KPTV co-anchor Gary Hill is a native son of Oregon and
graduate of both Linfield College and the Northwestern school of law at Lewis
and Clark College.</i></font></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>Hill grew up in Junction City, Oregon, where
as a teenager he was an aspiring math teacher, until a friend talked him into
working on the school newspaper.</i></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>&quot;I got hooked on writing and reporting. I
would have studied journalism in college except that Linfield, where I had a
scholarship, didn't offer that degree,&quot; Hill said. &quot;So I took all the
writing I could and coupled it with political science.&nbsp; Now I'm glad it
worked out that way.&nbsp; I have&nbsp; a broader education and everything I've
learned helps on a job like mine.</i></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>Hill came to KPTV in 1976 as political
reporter and general assignment reporter before becoming co-anchor with Kim
Singer in February of 1984. He has earned a law degree since joining KPTV and
was admitted to the Oregon State Bar in 1982.</i></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>&quot;It seemed like the natural thing to
do,&quot; said Hill. &quot;I'd been press secretary to Congressman Jim Weaver
for one year, and my degree from Linfield College was in political science and
communications. It all seemed to go together, along with writing and reporting
the news.&quot;</i></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>Hill is married and he and his wife reside in
Portland.&nbsp; His hobbies are racquetball and cooking.</i></font></p>
