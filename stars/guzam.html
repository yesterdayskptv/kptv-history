Guza</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="black" size="2">Monica
Guza is a native of the Pacific Northwest, born in Seattle, and raised in
Eugene. After a particularly rainy summer, she fled to Northern California...but
Oregon called her back. She majored in film and video production in college in
hopes of working in documentary film. Instead, she got an offer to work as a
weathercaster at KMTR in Eugene. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="black" size="2">She
joined the KPTV-Oregon's 12 in February 2000, and is the primary weather anchor
on the weekend editions of The 10 O'Clock News. Monica and her husband live
outside of town with their menagerie of cats, birds, and one lovable mutt. For
fun, Monica strives to keep 40 mature rosebushes alive, rides motorcycles, and
skis on both snow and water. You might also find her lending a critical eye to
the latest film, or planning her next tropical vacation. </font><!-- story ends here -->
