<b><font color="#FFFFFF" size="5" face="Arial">Andy

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="3" face="Arial">Expect
the unexpected with Andy Carson. The Wichita native has made a career zigging
when everyone else thinks he’s about to
zag. As the only male child in his
family, his father instantly proclaimed his future occupation a farmer. Several
years of raising sheep led to Andy’s first official
zig.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="3" face="Arial">But he liked acting. After cutting his teeth on high school productions,
young Andy was accepted to the Academy of Dramatic Arts in Pasadena, California.
It wasn’t long before Andy realized he fit in like…well like a sheep farmer
in a California acting school.
Zag.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="3" face="Arial">So television was the obvious next step. It’s still like acting, only
steady work, and no classes where you have to act like you’re a piece of
frying bacon. Best of all, no sheep.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="3" face="Arial">Andy majored in broadcasting at Pittsburg State University in Pittsburg,
Kansas. His biggest claim to fame in college was his internship on Late Night
With David Letterman. Andy appeared four times on the show and inspired the
character, Dwight the Troubled Teen.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="3" face="Arial">Upon graduation, Andy joined up with the local CBS affiliate,
KOAM, serving
the Pittsburg, Kansas/Joplin, Missouri market. He helped launch the station’s
morning show which eventually pulled a 65 share and had more viewers than the
competition’s evening news.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="3" face="Arial">His success landed him a job with ABC affiliate WSET in Roanoke and
Lynchburg, Virginia. The show doubled its previous year’s ratings in Andy’s
first book. The next book showed three times the ratings pull since Andy came
aboard.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="3" face="Arial">Andy Carson’s accurate forecasts are spiced up with his dry wit and his
wacky antics.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="3" face="Arial">Expect great things from Andy Carson and Good Day Oregon. Just don’t expect
a
zig.</font>
