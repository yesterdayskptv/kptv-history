        weekend
        newscasts
        and
        reporting
        during
        the
        week.
        <p>His
        first
        broadcasting
        job
        was
        at
        WHCU
        Radio
        in
        Ithaca,
        N.Y.
        He
        said
        that
        he
        enjoyed
        it
        so
        much
        that
        he
        decided
        to
        make
        broadcasting
        his
        career.
        <p>As
        a
        child,
        Ken's
        ambition
        was
        to
        be
        the
        first
        person
        on
        his
        mother's
        side
        of
        the
        family
        to
        graduate
        from
        college.
        He
        accomplished
        that
        goal
        at
        <a href="http://www.cornell.edu/">Cornell
        University</a>.
        <p>One
        of
        Ken's
        teachers
        in
        junior
        high
        school,
        Andrew
        Ray,
        had
        a
        significant
        impact
        upon
        Ken's
        life.
        Ray
        taught
        his
        students
        that
        high
        standards
        lead
        to
        exceptional
        work.
        He
        had
        a
        reputation
        for
        not
        giving
        any
        of
        his
        students
        an
        &quot;A&quot;
        grade.
        But
        Ken,
        determined
        to
        receive
        that
        &quot;A&quot;,
        worked
        diligently
        and
        made
        the
        grade.
        He's
        still
        proud
        of
        that
        achievement.
        <p>When
        Ken
        was
        about
        14,
        he
        got
        his
        first
        job
        working
        as
        a
        stock
        boy
        at
        a
        neighborhood
        supermarket.
        He
        recalled
        getting
        up
        at
        the
        crack
        of
        dawn
        to
        work
        before
        school.
        He
        said
        that
        getting
        up
        so
        early
        taught
        him
        about
        the
        importance
        of
        discipline.
        <p>Fortunately
        for
        Ken,
        those
        early
        morning
        workdays
        are
        in
        the
        past.
        He
        doesn't
        have
        to
        arrive
        at
        the
        KOIN
        6
        Newsroom
        until
        about
        9
        a.m.
        <p>Off
        the
        air,
        Ken
        is
        a
        sports
        buff.
        He
        enjoys
        playing
        golf,
        but
        admits
        that
        he's
        not
        very
        good.
        He's
        also
        a
        big
        fan
        of
        professional
        basketball.
        <p>&nbsp;Ken
        also
        likes
        watching
        movies.
        Some
        of
        his
        favorites
        include
        &quot;Glory,&quot;
        &quot;The
        Shawshank
        Redemption,&quot;
        &quot;Do
        the
        Right
        Thing,&quot;
        and
        &quot;Schindler's
        List.&quot;
        Ken
        thinks
        that
        Bill
        Cosby
        is
        the
        greatest.
        He
        was
        one
        of
        the
        first
        African-Americans
        to
        star
        in
        a
        dramatic
        series
        and
        he's
        been
        a
        pioneer
        in
        changing
        a
        lot
        of
        attitudes,
        with
        his
        positive
        portrayals
        of
        African-Americans,
        Ken
        said.
        <p>Ken
        wants
        everyone
        to
        know
        that
        he
        takes
        the
        power
        of
        television
        quite
        seriously,
        and
        although
        celebrity
        and
        recognition
        are
        a
        byproduct,
        they
        are
        not
        the
        goal.
        He
        believes
        that
        what
        journalists
        do
        has
        a
        significant
        effect
        on
        people's
        lives,
        and
        every
        story
        should
        be
        written
        and
        communicated
        clearly,
        accurately
        and
        without
        bias.
