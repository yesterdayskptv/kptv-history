<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">After an exhaustive national search for a co-anchor for
&quot;The 10 O’Clock News&quot; on KPTV-Oregon's 12, Shauna Parsons was named
to the team. She debuted on &quot;The 10 O’Clock News&quot; alongside Kurt
Ludlow on October 2nd, 2000.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">She came to Portland from Salt Lake City, where she was
morning anchor at KSTU. After years of getting up <u>before</u> the crack of
dawn, Shauna is thrilled to finally be getting some sleep!</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
<font face="Verdana">She's also thrilled to be doing her </font><a href="http://www.oregons12.tv/news/teens/"><font face="Verdana">&quot;Teens
Making a Difference&quot; </font></a><font face="Verdana">segment on &quot;The
10 O'Clock News,&quot; because it gives her the opportunity to get out into the
community and meet some incredible young people.</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">&quot;I think it's important to remind people that
despite some of the bad news they read and hear about each day, there are a lot
of very wonderful things happening in our community. We have a responsibility to
bring our viewers the good news too,&quot; says Shauna.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">Shauna has received awards from the Society of
Professional Journalists, the Utah Broadcasters Association, and was nominated
for an Emmy award for a story on animal euthanasia. One of Shauna’s most
memorable stories was one in which she served both as photographer and reporter;
she arranged to be checked into a battered women’s shelter where she
documented the lives of the women and children who went there for help. On the
lighter side, Shauna once passed out on camera while being &quot;needled&quot;
by an acupuncturist for a story on alternative medicine.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">Shauna started her journalism career in Provo, Utah
while attending Brigham Young University. She anchored the nightly news on KBYU-TV,
and produced and anchored a daily newscast on KBYU-FM. An internship at Salt
Lake City Fox affiliate KSTU lead to an on-air reporting position, then
subsequent jobs as weekend anchor, and morning anchor.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">Shauna, her husband Ivan and her son Jackson are happy
to call Portland home.</font></p>
