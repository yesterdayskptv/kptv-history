Ackerman co-hosts Good Day Oregon from 7-9am weekdays on KPTV Oregon’s 12.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF" size="3" face="Arial">Ken Ackerman’s keen eye for humor lets him bring more to the anchor chair
than his wealth of journalistic experience. Ken has been a steady fixture to
Portland viewers since 1989, serving two years at KGW (8) and KPTV-Oregon’s 12
since 1992.</font>

<p>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="3" face="Arial">With the feature as his forte, Ken has spent much of his time trolling for
stories that range from offbeat, to bizarre, to absurd. Once these stories are
processed by his writing and near-genius editing, they go from the ridiculous to
the sublime, his awards shelf being
Exhibit A, including three Northwest Emmy
nominations.</font>

<p>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="3" face="Arial">Ken was raised in Olympia, Washington and attended Olympia High School. A
natural athlete, Ken excelled on and off the playing field. He balanced a busy
high school schedule between 4 varsity sports and serving as Student Body
President.</font>

<p>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="3" face="Arial">His formal education took him to Western Washington University and then to
the University of Southern California, where he graduated with a Bachelor’s
degree in Journalism in 1983.</font>

<p>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="3" face="Arial">Ken’s initial foray into the TV news business landed him jobs on both
coasts of the United States, finally in 1989 Ken came home to the Pacific
Northwest to stay.</font>

<p>
<font face="Arial"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="3">Ken’s commitment to the community is evident in his involvement as a Mentor
