    <i><b>Old Friend From KPTV Needs Your Help<br>
    </b></i><br>
    Hello, everyone:<br>
    <br>
    I am a friend of Valerie Bass, the widow of Donavin Bass, who was a longtime 
    director at KPTV.<br>
    <br>
    <img border="0" src="../ValerieBass.jpg" width="300" height="225" align="left">Valerie 
    and her daughter, Danielle, are in desperate need of help with legal fees in 
    an incredible case involving the custody of Danielle's <br>
    3-year old daughter, Kassiah, and the custody of Danielles' soon to be born 
    second child. The baby, a boy, will be born any minute (he was due on Dec. 
    16th) and will be named Donavin.<br>
    <br>
    The case is complex, but it boils down to this:<br>
    <br>
    The paternal grandmother of Danielle's first child, Kassiah, has launched a 
    move to gain permanent custody of Kassiah and take her away from Valerie and 
    Danielle.<br>
    <br>
    Valerie and Danielle are also fighting a move to have Danielle's new baby 
    removed from Danielle as soon as he is born.<br>
    <br>
    An avalanche of charges has been launched, resulting in the accusation that 
    Valerie and Danielle's home is unfit for Kassiah and the new baby.<br>
    <br>
    Here is the chain of events:<br>
    <br>
    Danielle and her daughter, Kassiah, have been living with Valerie. Kassiah's 
    father and Danielle are no longer together. He lives in California, but his 
    family, who lives in Portland, has long wanted custody of Kassiah.<br>
    <br>
    Danielle has a new, serious boyfriend she plans to marry. His name is Sean, 
    and he is the father of her<br>
    soon to be born baby boy. Sean also lives with Danielle, Kassiah and 
    Valerie.<br>
    <br>
    The family of Kassiah's father claims Sean abused Kassiah. This began when 
    Kassiah got a bump on her head which actually required no treatment. Valerie 
    believes this happened by Kassiah falling out of bed.<br>
    <br>
    The family of Kassiah's father called Children's Protective Services. 
    Valerie says police officers came to her home &quot;like a raid.&quot; Sean was 
    briefly handcuffed, questioned and released - but Kassiah (that night at the 
    grandparents' home) was put into the protective custody of those 
    grandparents where she has been since October 27th. Valerie has been allowed 
    only once-a-month, supervised meetings with her granddaughter, who she loves 
    more than life itself.<br>
    <br>
    Children's Services also told Danielle and Valerie that the new baby, 
    Donavin, will be taken from Danielle<br>
    as soon as he is born. This has torn Val's heart out. Danielle is facing one 
    child being taken away, and now her new baby too.<br>
    <br>
    When all this began, Danielle was given a court-appointed attorney, but when 
    we saw how little he was doing<br>
    for Valerie and Danielle, it became clear that she would need a good 
    attorney who would really fight for her.<br>
    <br>
    The new attorney's name is Brad Lechman-Su. He is terrific and started 
    working right away on stopping the<br>
    move to take Danielle's new baby away, when he is born. So far, Protective 
    Services is unwilling to budge. UPDATE - Protective Services is beginning to 
    consider allowing Danielle to keep this child but they want to retain<br>
    protective custody.<br>
    <br>
    My partner and I have paid Mr. Lechman-Su's retainer fee of $2,500 as a loan 
    to Val and Danielle. However, this attorney says such a case could cost 
    between $5,000 and $8,000 if it doesn't have to go to a jury, and much more 
    if<br>
    it does.<br>
    <br>
    We are hopeful that Mr. Lechman-Su will succeed in getting this resolved 
    quickly and without going to court. But for now, Valerie simply doesn't have 
    the $5,000 to $8,000 it will take to fight this case.<br>
    <br>
    All who know Val will remember how hard she worked to care for Donavin when 
    he was so ill with cancer, and to make a great and loving home for Danielle. 
    Her efforts on Danielle's behalf have continued through the years. Now<br>
    she finds herself fighting for Danielle and her grandchildren's custody.<br>
    <br>
    I have been following these events as Val has sent e-mails regarding the 
    changing situation.<br>
    <br>
    I am writing to ask, if in remembrance of Donavin and in regard for Val, you 
    might help her by making a donation to her legal costs in this very 
    heart-wrenching circumstance.<br>
    <br>
    Anything you could contribute would help and would be deeply appreciated. A 
    trust account in Val's name has been set up at US Bank in Beaverton. But you 
    can make a contribution at any US Bank to the Valerie and Danielle Bass<br>
    contribution account,<br>
    <br>
    <b>#153 656 718 126. </b><br>
    <br>
    As Val's close friend, I would be happy to answer any questions you have 
    about Val's circumstance. My phone number is <b>503-641-9558</b> and my 
    e-mail address is <b>missingmatika@aol.com</b>.<br>
    <br>
    You can also call Val directly at <b>503-642-2438</b>. Her cell is <b>
    503-349-5340</b>.<br>
    <br>
    Life has been rough for Val since losing Donavin, and Kassiah has been her 
    joy. For her to now lose Kassiah and little Donavin is just too much for 
    her.<br>
    <br>
    I sincerely hope and pray you will join me in helping Val in her battle to 
    keep her family together.<br>
    <br>
    Thank you for your consideration.<br>
    <br>

    <i><b>LATEST UPDATE: December 22nd.<br>
    <br>
    Donavin entered the world at 3:39 a.m. today. Sean and Val stayed with 
    Danielle throughout the labor and delivery, and then Sean left for his 
    father's house in Idaho, in hopes that this will help Danielle to keep her 
    baby until the legality of this incredible situation is resolved.</b></i><p><b><span style="background-color: #0000FF">
